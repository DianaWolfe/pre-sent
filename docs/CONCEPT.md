# Concept: pre.SENT

## The Name

pre.SENT. Present tense. The art exists only now. The period breaks the word open: what is presented, what is a present, what is present. All of it is temporary.

## The Idea

A self-portrait that is different every time you look at it.

The gallery generates original artwork in real time based on the psychological eras of one life. Visitors use a slider to move through developmental stages, from the magical thinking of childhood through the fractures of crisis to the sovereignty of self-authorship. Each position generates new art using DALL-E 3, filtered through the emotional and aesthetic DNA of that life period.

Nothing is saved. When you leave, the images are gone. The gallery exists only in the present tense.

## Why Ephemeral

Persistence implies that art is an object. pre.SENT argues that art is an event. The viewer's presence is what causes the work to exist. Their absence is what causes it to end. This mirrors the psychological premise: identity is not a fixed thing you have. It is something that happens, continuously, in the present.

The ephemeral design also makes a practical point about AI-generated art. These images have no provenance, no artist's hand, no material substrate. They are computationally possible but ontologically thin. Making them disappear is more honest than pretending they are permanent works.

## Why Life Eras

The slider is not a style selector. It is a developmental timeline grounded in psychological theory:

- **Piaget** (cognitive development): How the mind perceives reality changes with age
- **Erikson** (psychosocial stages): Each era poses a different existential challenge
- **Kegan** (constructive development): The relationship between self and world restructures at each stage
- **Kübler-Ross** (grief): Crisis is its own developmental period with its own visual language
- **Tedeschi & Calhoun** (post-traumatic growth): What comes after crisis is not recovery to baseline but growth beyond it

The art should feel like looking at the inside of someone's head during each period. Not illustration of events. Emotional landscape.

## Why Autobiographical

The eras are one person's life. The gallery is a self-portrait. This is deliberate. AI art is often criticized for lacking a point of view. By constraining the generation to a specific human psychology, we test whether AI can produce work that feels personally meaningful even though the system has no personal experience.

The question pre.SENT asks: can AI make autobiographical art if it is given an autobiography?

## Connection to Broader Work

pre.SENT sits within a research program on human-AI collaboration, specifically the question of co-evolution. In collaborative intelligence, co-evolution describes how both the human and the AI change through interaction. pre.SENT is a simple case study: the human provides psychological structure, the AI provides visual execution, and the resulting work belongs to neither alone.

It also connects to trust architecture. Visitors must trust the system to do something interesting with their attention. The ephemeral design raises the stakes: you cannot screenshot your way to ownership. You have to be present.
