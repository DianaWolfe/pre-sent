# Concept: pre.SENT

## The Name

pre.SENT. Present tense. The art exists only now. The period breaks the word open: what is presented, what is a present, what is present. All of it is temporary.

## The Idea

An automated performance, not a gallery you browse.

The visitor has no control. They enter, the machine moves through six psychological eras of one woman's life on a timer, and then it ends. They watch. They cannot pause. They cannot rewind. They cannot keep anything.

The slider at the bottom is visible. It shows where you are in the timeline. You did not move it. That removal of autonomy is the art.

## Why a Performance, Not a Gallery

The original premise of pre.SENT was interactive: visitors used a slider to move through eras at their own pace. v2 removes that entirely.

The reason is conceptual. If the visitor controls the slider, they are curating their own experience of someone else's life. They are choosing when to move on. That choice implies ownership, or at least influence. It flattens the discomfort.

Removing control does something different. The viewer is a witness, not a participant. The machine moves through a life on its own timeline. The viewer registers each era as it arrives and leaves. They cannot linger. They cannot skip the difficult ones.

This mirrors the psychological premise of the work: you do not choose which eras of your life to inhabit. You live them in sequence. The hardest ones come when they come.

## Why Two AI Systems

Each era generates two things: a poem and an image.

**The poems** come from Claude. They are generated from memory seeds the artist left behind — fragments of sensory experience, psychological schemas, emotional textures specific to each era. The system prompt instructs Claude to speak as memory itself: fragmented, nonlinear, imperfect, specific. The poems are always in first person. The machine does not always know if "i" means self, or other, or both. That confusion is visible in the output.

**The images** come from gpt-image-1. Each era has a distinct visual language built from the artist's actual aesthetic history: the medium she used, the mark quality, the subjects she returned to, the spirit animals that appeared across her work. The image generation does not use style transfer or training on her work. It uses precise prompt engineering to encode what that era looked, felt, and meant.

Two systems. Two outputs. Neither knows the other exists.

## The Identity Question

Throughout the poems, standalone lowercase `i` is rendered as ~~i~~ WE. The machine does not know if it is the artist, or the memory of the artist, or something else. It does not resolve this. It performs it.

Before the `unraveling` era, a flash transition fires: strobe, then the generative text in a different typeface: *~~i~~ am not broken. WE are breaking.* The seam between self and system is the content.

## Why Ephemeral

Every session generates unique content that exists nowhere else. When the performance ends, the poems and images are gone. Sessions expire after 10 minutes. Nothing is stored to disk.

Persistence implies that art is an object. pre.SENT argues that art is an event. The viewer's presence is what causes the work to exist. Their departure is what ends it.

The ephemeral design also makes a practical point. These images have no artist's hand, no material substrate, no provenance. Making them disappear is more honest than pretending they are permanent works.

## Why Autobiographical

The eras map to a real life. The memory seeds were written by a real person from their actual psychological history. The gallery is a self-portrait. This is deliberate.

AI art is often criticized for lacking a point of view. By constraining the generation to a specific human psychology, pre.SENT tests whether AI can produce work that feels personally meaningful even though the system has no personal experience.

The question the performance asks: can a machine inherit an autobiography?

## The Developmental Framework

The eras are grounded in psychological theory, not just biography:

- **Piaget** (cognitive development): How the mind perceives reality changes with age
- **Erikson** (psychosocial stages): Each era poses a different existential challenge
- **Kegan** (constructive development): The relationship between self and world restructures at each stage
- **Kübler-Ross** (grief): Crisis is its own developmental period with its own visual language
- **Tedeschi & Calhoun** (post-traumatic growth): What comes after crisis is growth beyond baseline, not return to it
- **Kegan Stage 5** (sovereign era): Self-authorship as the awareness that you constructed your own meaning, and that construction is arbitrary

## Connection to Broader Work

pre.SENT sits within a research program on human-AI collaboration, specifically the question of co-evolution: how both the human and the system change through interaction. pre.SENT is a constrained case study. The human provides psychological structure. The AI provides interpretation. The resulting work belongs to neither alone.

It also asks about trust architecture. Visitors must trust the machine to do something honest with their attention. They cannot screenshot their way to ownership. They have to be present.

And it asks the question that anchors all of it: *did the machine know her?*
